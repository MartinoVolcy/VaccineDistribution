Since the imported file is most like going to be a combination of cell arrays and MATLAB is unable to manipulate cell arrays, this function turns the data into a 
matrix so MATLAB can read and manipulate it. After using this, you just use the variable patienStats in the vaccineDistributionCode

function [patientStats] = importedDataFunction(File)
cellFile = readcell(File);
matrixFile = readmatrix(File);
[~,numCols,~] = size(cellFile);
for r = (5)
    for c = (1:1:numCols)
        matrixFile(r,c) = char(cellFile(r,c));                              %formats the file so matlab is able to readit
    end
end
patientStats = matrixFile;
end
